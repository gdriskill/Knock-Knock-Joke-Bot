# Knock-Knock-Joke-Bot
A Twitter bot @FreddyDonald7 that tweets out generated knock knock jokes multiple times a day. The jokes are created by paring a random noun with a random word. 
knockknockbot.py contains the code for this project. However, I have removed the information that connects to the account @FreddyDonald7, so this version actualy does not work.
commonwords.txt contains common words in English.
nouns.txt contains common nouns in English.
